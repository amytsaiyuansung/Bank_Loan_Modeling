# Bank_Loan_Modeling
The dataset is from Thera Bank, a small regional bank, available on Kaggle. The model helps predict which depositors with a higher likelihood to convert to depositors. 

This project is a classification issue, aiming to target customer to offer bank loan offer. Three types of classification models are built, models include decision tree, KNN, and logistic regression. Due to the imbalance of the two classes, we also built other 3 models on the resampled data. The best performance occurs when using the decision tree model after the resampling. The accuracy is 0.98, with 0.94 AUC score.
